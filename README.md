## Project description <br>
Automated Yumcha services, Yumacha Bots will use 2 robotic arms to service and deliver fresh dumpling dishes to the customers. The robotic arms will travel on carts, one arm travelling to place empty plates and chopsticks for the customers to use and another robot travelling and placing requested dishes onto the table. <be>

## Robotic Arms

**Industrial robotic arm: ***KUKA KR 6 R900***** <br>
  - We wanted a robotic arm with greater reach and a higher payload capacity to provide us with flexibility in moving and placing dishes as they will often vary in weight. We wanted the greater reach of the arm, as the dishes will place at the centre of the table. <br>

**Existing robotic arm: ***Universal Robots UR3***** <br>

### Code Function: <br>
**GUI** - where you can request plates and dumplings, emergency stop <br>

## To Do Tasks: <br>
- model KUKA robotic arm
- GUI
- Collision detection
- Grippers
- Robot class folder
- trolley movement
- robotic arm movement
- initial position to final position etc

## Notes:<br>
- object class draft completed, cart edit to be 2 links? 
one prismatic and one revolute to allow for the cart to rotate and move? 
(z axis rotation - wheels) (z-axis translocation for kart)?
- might need to adjust scale of objects
