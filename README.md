Project description: <br>
Automated Yumcha services, Yumacha Bots will use 2 robotic arms to service and deliver fresh dumpling dishes to the customers. The robotic arms will travel on carts, one arm travelling to place empty plates and chopsticks for the customers to use and another robot travelling and placing request dishes onto the table. <br>

Industrial robotic arm: <br>
KUKA KR 6 R900: We wanted a robotic arm with greater reach and a higher payload capacity to provide us with the flexibility in moving and placing dishes as they will often vary in weight. We wanted the greater reach of the arm, as the dishes will place a the centre of the table. <br>

Existing robotic arm: <br>
Universal Robots UR3e <br>
